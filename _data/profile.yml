    Hi! I am currently an incoming assistant professor in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, Riverside. I got my Ph.D. from University of Pittsburgh, advised by&nbsp;<a href="http://xzt102.github.io/" target="_blank" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-hover-palette-1-base u-text-palette-5-dark-3 u-btn-1">Dr. Xulong Tang</a>. I received my B.E. and M.S. degree from the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University in 2017 and 2020, respectively.

  <p>
    My research interests lie broadly in <span style="font-weight: 700;" class="u-text-grey-80">advanced computer architectures</span>, <span class="u-text-grey-80" style="font-weight: 700;">high-performance computing systems</span>, and <span class="u-text-grey-80" style="font-weight: 700;">emerging parallel applications</span>, with a specific focus on GPU ecosystem from architecture to application. My work aims to design architectures and system features for next-generation GPU systems, enabling and supporting emerging large-scale applications on both single- and multi-GPU platforms. I am also workig on system-level optimizations for <span style="font-weight: 700;">large language models serving</span>, as part of my internship at NVIDIA Research in Summer’24.
